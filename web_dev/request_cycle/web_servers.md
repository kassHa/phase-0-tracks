1. What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
     Open source.
     Linux is primarily developed as a group effort by volunteers on the Internet from all over the world
     Anyone who has a new feature or software application to add to the system generally makes it available in an "alpha" stage--that is, a stage for testing by those brave users who want to bash out problems with the initial code.

2. In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)?
It is a virtual machine sold as a service by internet hosting service. A VPS runs its own copy of an operating system, and customers have superuser-level access to that operating system instance, so they can install almost any software that runs on that OS.

3. Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
If you are logged as as root, all apllications are running with root privilegies and every vulnerability in Firefox, Flash, OpenOffice etc. now can destroy the system, because possible viruses now have access everywhere. Also small bug in an application could erase some system files.
