1. Display the information in one table (either table is fine).

sqlite> SELECT * FROM students;
1|Kasha|27|2
2|Arhie|30|1
3|Eddie|20|2
4|Alex|25|1

2. Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

sqlite> UPDATE students SET age=40 WHERE name="Alex";
sqlite> SELECT * FROM students;
1|Kasha|27|2
2|Arhie|30|1
3|Eddie|20|2
4|Alex|40|1

3. Display the information in both tables using one query.

sqlite> SELECT * FROM students, teachers WHERE students.teacher_id = teachers.id;
1|Kasha|27|2|2|Mr. O'Connor
2|Arhie|30|1|1|Mr. Booth
3|Eddie|20|2|2|Mr. O'Connor
4|Alex|40|1|1|Mr. Booth

4. Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.

sqlite> SELECT students.name, teachers.name FROM students JOIN teachers ON students.teacher_id = teachers.id;
Kasha|Mr. O'Connor
Arhie|Mr. Booth
Eddie|Mr. O'Connor
Alex|Mr. Booth

5. Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

sqlite> DELETE FROM students WHERE id = 3;
sqlite> SELECT students.name, teachers.name FROM students JOIN teachers ON students.teacher_id = teachers.id;
Kasha|Mr. O'Connor
Arhie|Mr. Booth
Alex|Mr. Booth
sqlite>
