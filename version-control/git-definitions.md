# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Something that allows you to create and work on different versions of the same projects, and it is useful because it allows you to experiment without affecting the main version. Also you can go back in time to find previous versions.
 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?

It is a copy of the main repo and I use it to make changes or fix bugs before changing the main software.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

Commit allows to save changes in the branch, and save time of the changes. Good commit message is the one that describes changes. For example after a year if I look at the commit message I know what was changed. 

* What is a merge conflict?

Merge conflict is for example when two teamates are working on one project. and they both change the same part of code and each of them is trying to merge it. In this case version control doesn't one schould be implemented.
